            <blockquote cite="https://www.popsci.com/diy/google-calendar-time-insights/"><p>In today’s data-heavy world, there seems to be no shortage of tools that collect and display
                information about our lives, ripe for whatever level of analysis you’d like. Google Calendar is
                no different, with an easy-to-miss feature called Time Insights.</p>
                <p>Introduced at the end of August, this analytical tool rests within the left-hand sidebar when viewing
                    GCal on a computer—you won’t see it in the app. It takes up a mere five lines (one if you’ve somehow
                    minimized it), so it’s possible to overlook if you’re not constantly poring over your schedule or only
                    work out of the Android or iOS app. Whether you’ve noticed it or not, understanding how it works may
                    help you better structure your day.</p></blockquote>
        </article>
        <article class="sections">
            <h2>How to see and use Time Insights</h2>
            <p>When not minimized, Time Insights displays the same chunk of time visible on the main calendar page
                (perhaps a day, week, month, or year), how much of that is filled by meetings, and how that compares
                to your average total meeting time across the three previous equivalent periods. For example,
                if you’re looking at the week of Dec. 19 to 25, it may say you have five hours of scheduled meetings
                after averaging 1.9 hours over the past three weeks.</p>
            <p>Google also displays this information with a multi-colored bar that’s divided into chunks for “focus time,”
                meetings, and meetings you have yet to respond to. Hover your cursor over the graphic and you’ll see
                the total and average times for each category.</p>
            <p><strong>[Related:<u> How to slow down time because you’re not getting any younger</u>]</strong></p>
            <p>From there, you can click <strong>More insights</strong> to view, well, more time insights. If you’ve minimized the
                tool, you can click the <strong>More insights icon</strong> (a rising line graph festooned with sparkles). Doing so
                will bring up a new sidebar on the right side of your screen. Only you and anyone who can edit your
                calendar can see this information.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="sections">
            <h2>Time breakdown</h2>
            <p>The prime feature here is the time breakdown ring, which is broken into separate colors for focus time,
                one-on-ones, meetings with three or more guests, requests you haven’t responded to, and—if enabled—how many
                remaining work hours you have in the day, week, or whatever time period you’re looking at.</p>
            <p>Hover your cursor over a color and it’ll dim all events on your calendar except ones that match the type
                you’re on, putting a shadow under those so you can see them easier among everything else on your calendar.</p>

        <article class="sections">
            <h2>Focus time</h2>
            <p>The top entry on this ring is <strong>Focus time</strong>, a feature <u>Google introduced in late October</u>. The company
                said in a blog post that it hopes this will help people schedule time for individual work,
                and it will show up alongside the standard “out of office” and “event” tags when you create a calendar
                entry. Focus time is only available for people with work or school Google accounts.</p>
            <p>To set it up from Time Insights, click <strong>Schedule focus time</strong>. This will bring up a standard calendar
                event dialog box, where you can customize the entry’s name, time, color, and other attributes.
                To truly focus, check the box next to <strong>Automatically decline meetings.</strong></p>

        <article class="sections">
            <h2>Working hours</h2>
            <p>To include all your working hours on the time breakdown ring, click either <strong>Set working hours</strong> or <strong>Adjust
                working hours</strong>, depending on if you’ve enabled this function or not. This will take you to the main
                Calendar settings page, where you’ll need to find the <strong>Working hours & location</strong> heading and make sure
                you’ve checked the box next to <strong>Enable working hours</strong>. You can then enter or adjust your working hours.
                If you have these set and someone tries to schedule a meeting with you outside of your workday,
                Google will let them know you’re unavailable.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="sections">
            <h2>Time in meetings</h2>
            <p>Under the time breakdown ring, there’s a <strong>Time in meetings</strong> heading. This shows you which day you tend
                to have the most meetings, your daily average of time spent in meetings over the past three weeks,
                and colored bars detailing your current calendar view, the next time period of the same length,
                and the two prior equivalent chunks of time. These have separate colors for recurring and one-time
                meetings, and if you hover your cursor over a block you’re currently in, GCal will highlight all
                meetings of that type.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="sections">
            <h2>People you meet with</h2>
            <p>The last heading on the Time Insights sidebar is <strong>People you meet with</strong>. This shows who you have the most
                meetings with in the selected time period, and you can pin up to 10 people to always see your shared
                meeting time. You’ll also see colored bars that indicate whether these meetings are one-on-one or in
                a group of up to 15 people—mouse over them to highlight them on the main calendar. If you don’t have
                a meeting with a pinned person within the chosen time period, this section will also tell you when
                your next meeting with them is.</p>
