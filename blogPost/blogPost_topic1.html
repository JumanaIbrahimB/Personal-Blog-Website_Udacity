        <h2>Bring your bookmarks closer</h2>
        <p>If you stash your most useful and important bookmarks on your browser’s toolbar for easy access, you
            won’t need to wade through menus to find them. Most popular browsers have a special folder you can save
            bookmarks to if you want them on-screen, and you’ll usually see the option to send them there whenever
            you save a bookmark or manage your existing ones.</p>
        <p>To see these links on Chrome, open the menu (three dots, top right) then choose <strong>Bookmarks</strong> and <strong>Show
            Bookmarks Bar</strong>. On Firefox, click the menu button (three lines, top right) and select <strong>Bookmarks</strong>, and
            <strong>Show bookmarks toolbar</strong>. In Edge, open the menu (three dots, top right), then click <strong>Favorites</strong>, find
            the <strong>More Options button</strong> (three dots) in the top right of the popup dialog box, and select <strong>Show favorites
                bar</strong>. Finally in Safari, choose <strong>View</strong> and <strong>Show Favorites Bar</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Save smarter bookmarks</h2>
        <p>Speaking of bookmarks, you can be clever about the URLs you save to speed up your travels around the web.
            If you’re a Gmail user, you’ve almost certainly bookmarked your inbox, but you can also bookmark your
            <u>Gmail drafts</u> and <u>starred emails</u>. If you use Slack, you can make bookmarks that’ll lead you straight
            to your unread threads or specific direct message conversations (the URLs for these will be personal to you).</p>
        <p><strong>[Related: <u>How to save all the new posts you find on social media</u>]</strong></p>
        <p>You can also create a new blank Google Doc by following the <u>docs.new</u> web address. Bookmark this link
            for a quick and easy way to create new documents in the future (try <u>sheets.new</u> and <u>slides.new</u>, too).</p>
        <p>Bookmark searches as well—whether on <u>Twitter</u>, <u>Wikipedia</u>, or somewhere else—so you don’t have to keep
            typing out your search terms every time.</p>

        <h2>Use your keyboard</h2>
        <p>Don’t neglect your keyboard while using the web—the <strong>Home</strong> button whizzes you back up to the top of the page,
            while <strong>End</strong> drops you to the bottom, for example. <strong>Page Up</strong> and <strong>Page Down</strong> can be used for scrolling,
            while <strong>Ctrl+W</strong> (or <strong>Cmd+W</strong> on a Mac) closes the current tab, and </strong>Ctrl+T</strong>
            (or while<strong>Ctrl+W</strong> (or <strong>Cmd+W</strong> on a Mac) closes the current tab, and </strong>Ctrl+T</strong>
            (or <strong>Cmd+T</strong> on a Mac) opens up a new one. For a comprehensive guide to browser keyboard
            shortcuts, check out <a>our detailed guide right here.</a></p>

        <h2>Reduce page loads</h2>
        <p>Modern-day web pages come packed with scripts, code, and interactive elements that can seriously
            slow down both loading times and how quickly you can get around sites. The good news is that numerous
            third-party extensions are available to limit how much your browser has to deal with at once.</p>
        <p>Our favorites include <u>Ghostery</u> (for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari), <u>NoScript</u> (Firefox), and <u>Privacy
            Badger</u> (Chrome, Firefox, and Edge). All these add-ons let you whitelist ads on sites you want to support.</p>

        <h2>Ditch inactive tabs</h2>
        <p>Modern-day web browsers treat tabs almost like separate applications, to make sure they run more
            smoothly and don’t bring the whole browser down if they crash. The downside to this approach is that
            too many tabs can really start to suck up system resources and slow your web browsing to a crawl.</p>
        <p>Browser extensions can help you out here: <u>OneTab</u> is an excellent tab manager for Chrome and Firefox
            that lets you save tabs for later viewing. <u>The Great Suspender</u> for Chrome, meanwhile, will suspend
            inactive tabs until you need them, freeing up memory and CPU time. <u>Auto Tab Discard</u> does a similar job for Firefox).
            <u>Cluster</u> for Chrome and <u>Tab Manager Plus</u> for Firefox are also worth a look for saving tabs for later,
            meaning you won’t have to keep dozens open at once.</p>

        <h2>Start off right</h2>
        <p>Your browser of choice will have numerous options for when it starts up and what it displays on
            newly opened tabs, so make sure you’re using the ones that will keep you the most productive.
            Don’t keep a home page that you immediately click away from, for example.</p>
        <p>In Chrome, choose <strong>Settings</strong> from the menu, then look under <strong>On startup</strong> to configure what appears when
            you launch the browser: You can choose the standard New Tab page, carry on with the pages you had open
            when Chrome was last closed, or select a specific page or set of pages.</p>
        <p>You can find similar options in Firefox (pick <strong>Settings</strong> from the menu, then find the <strong>Startup</strong> heading),
            and in Edge (choose <strong>Settings</strong> from the menu, click <strong>Start, home and new tabs</strong>, and find the <strong>When Edge
                starts</strong> heading). In Safari, you’re limited to a single page: Open <strong>Safari, Preferences</strong>, then <strong>General</strong> to set it.</p>
        <p>Plenty of third-party plug-ins work with Chrome and Firefox to give you something a little different
            from the new tab page: <u>Tabliss</u> loads up a to-do list and your favorite bookmarks, for example, while
            <u>Speed Dial 2</u> for Chrome and <u>Infinity New Tab</u> for Firefox put the bookmarks you need right at your fingertips.</p>
